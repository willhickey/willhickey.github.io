My city only plows arterial streets. Snows on neighborhood streets is quickly packed down by car 
traffic. This snowpack is easy enough to drive on but inconvenient to bike on and takes a while
to melt. So I decided to build a snowplow for my Honda Civic to (hopefully) plow streets from my 
house out to the nearest arterial streets (2 and 3 blocks away, respectively).

Here's my first attempt. It cost $30 in parts (plus a Honda Civic, which I had lying around) and 
took 2 hours to assemble:

[![Snowplow](/assets/images/snowplow01.jpg)](/assets/images/snowplow01.jpg)

Parts:

* 6' 2x10
* (2) 1' 2x4
* (4) 3" angle brackets
* (2) hook screws
* 10' chain
* (8) 5/16 x 2" bolts (with nuts)
* (4) 5/16 x 4" bolts (with nuts, and 2 washers)
* Plus a vehicle with a ball hitch

The 2x4s are carved out (using a router or spade bit) so they will form a tight clamshell around the 
ball hitch (which is inverted in my setup). Then they're bolted together around the ball. The middle 
of the 2x10 is attached to the other end of the 2x4s using the angle brackets and remaining bolts

At this point the plow is firmly attached to the car but can still pivot on the ball. The screw hooks 
and chain prevent the blade from pivoting, but provide a simple way to change the angle of the plow 
so it can be used as a simple pusher or angled as a side plow.

I'm happy with the results considering the minimal design, but a number of improvements are needed.
Here's [a video of the plow in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oPFvrKj050).

There are three main problems:

1. The 2x10 isn't slippery enough to shed snow to the side when the plow is angled. Setting the plow 
straight and using it as a pusher works but limits the length of a plowing run as the snow piles up
in front of the blade.
2. The bottom of the plow is just the rounded edge of the 2x10. This tends to skate over packed snow 
instead of scraping it.
3. Because the plow doesn't lift it drags snow with it when I drive forward

And my current plans to remedy these problems:

1. Cover the front surface of the 2x10 with flashing which will hopefully help the snow slide along
blade so the plow can be used at an angle for longer runs.
2. Add a rubber cutting edge. I'm hoping to copy [this design](http://woodchuckcanuck.com/2014/01/19/mooseplow-redneck-cutting-edge/)
which makes use of an old tire.
3. Add small mechanical lifters like [these ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0AHrpLKCZc)
