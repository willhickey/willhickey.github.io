My city only plows arterial streets. Snows on neighborhood streets is quickly packed down by car 
traffic. This snowpack is easy enough to drive on but inconvenient to bike on and takes a while
to melt. So I decided to build a snowplow for my Honda Civic to (hopefully) plow streets from my 
house out to the nearest arterial streets (2 and 3 blocks away, respectively).

Here's my first attempt. It cost $30 in parts (plus a few parts I had already) and took 2 hours to
assemble:
